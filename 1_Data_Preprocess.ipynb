The timing of Cohen\\u2019s testimony was first reported by NBC. Cohen confirmed that he would testify to the committee on Tuesday and said he did not know whether it would be in a closed session or public. Aides to the committee\\u2019s leaders did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen said previously he had received a subpoena from at least one of the congressional committees investigating what U.S. intelligence has determined were Russia\\u2019s efforts to influence the election on Trump\\u2019s behalf, and whether Trump associates colluded with Russia. Russia denies such activity. The White House denies any collusion, but concerns about the issue and Trump\\u2019s ties to Russia have shadowed the first months of the Republican\\u2019s presidency. Cohen, a personal attorney to Trump, would be one of a series of close associates of the president to testify in Congress. Members of both the Senate and House of Representatives committees conducting investigations have said they expect to call more. Trump\\u2019s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month. \",\n          \"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s main opposition leader said on Monday President Robert Mugabe s refusal to resign had dampened people s spirits and called for an inclusive political process in the aftermath of a military intervention last week.

It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  Beasley told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley was frustrated that his complaints to management never got addressed, so he sued.  It s owned by an African American owner, but he gives full authority to the Hispanics to run it,  he told reporters.  It just caught me by surprise because here I am getting fired when I m trying to fix the problem. Beasley explained to CBS that he became homeless after he lost his job, so the hefty settlement becomes a huge victory for the grandfather from Compton.His lawyer Scott Cummings hopes that this win sends a message to other businesses out there.

Apparently believing that commitment and sincerity can be measured in decibels, Hillary Clinton turned up the volume in Sunday night\\u2019s showdown with rival Bernie Sanders.  She also matched her louder volume with sharper attacks on Sanders. But the Vermont socialist came ready to fight, counterpunching and even landing a few blows. You\\u2019d have to give him the win, if only narrowly, on the grounds that not only did he dominate the discussion but that she was strangely treating him as the frontrunner.  Or maybe it was just that she was trying to fight on Sanders\\u2019 turf. He\\u2019s been shouting since before it was cool. Clinton seems to be abandoning the mantra of her campaign \\u2013 \\u201cI\\u2019m a fighter\\u201d \\u2013 for an effort to approximate the anger that candidates on both sides of the aisle have been trying, with varying degrees of success, to ape.  But it\\u2019s hard to believe that Clinton is angry, or at least that she is angry about something other than the fact that her party seems to delight in spurning her. Life has been very good to the Clintons over the past 16 years, to say the least. Except for the politics part.  Clinton and her crew could assuage themselves after her 2008 primary loss that they were victims of history \\u2013 the sudden ascendance of a gifted, African-American candidate was more of a force of nature than a reflection of her political weakness.  But what if she were struggling with a guy who was deeply white and five years older than her? What if the guy this time was not a gifted speechmaker but one who gave shout-y campaign boilerplate in a Brooklyn honk? What if he had been honking around Washington for 25 years and was generally written off as a crank?  It has apparently all been enough to rattle Clinton, whose onetime indulgence of Sanders has turned into attacks and who seems to be on the verge of yet another campaign reboot.  Tied or trailing Sanders in the first two nominating contests, it\\u2019s hard to say she\\u2019s wrong. A huge lead in South Carolina and what, last month at least, was a wide advantage in Nevada still suggest that Clinton isn\\u2019t yet in danger of being toppled a second time \\u2013 and that her strategy of aggressively pursuing black voters and other parts of the Obama coalition is paying off.  But would those leads look so stout if Clinton were to lose the first two contests? Certainly not. Just ask South Carolina Democratic powerbroker Rep. Jim Clyburn, who told the NYT, \\u201cThe reality is, if Mrs. Clinton loses Iowa and New Hampshire, that could create new and real problems for her here.\\u201d  As of now, you can still call Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee, but we are now seeing a scenario in which she might have to waste several damaging months on a fight that will harm her general election chances and distract public attention from the bazooka blasts on the GOP side.

Montesquieu led something of a dissipated life as a young nobleman at court in Paris, but became increasingly serious about his political writing and philosophizing. A visit to England would open his mind further and give birth to a riot of political thought. But perhaps chief among his insights was the value of divided government.\\u00a0Britannica explains: \\u201cDividing\\u00a0political authority\\u00a0into the legislative, executive, and judicial powers, [Montesquieu] asserted that, in the state that most effectively promotes liberty, these three powers must be confided to different individuals or bodies, acting independently\\u2026 Though its accuracy has in more recent times been disputed, in its own century it was admired and held authoritative, even in England; it inspired the\\u00a0Declaration of the Rights of Man\\u00a0and the\\u00a0Constitution of the United States.\\u201d  NYT DUMPS ON HEIDI CRUZ   The NYT digs deep into the life of Ted Cruz\\u2019s wife, Heidi, with a focus on an incident 11 years ago in which a police officer found her, head in hands, sitting beside an expressway onramp.

One might assume that establishment support would flow to Cruz, a lifelong Republican and sitting senator. Not necessarily, says Molly Ball in a dispatch from the trail: \\u201cSome Republicans who have moved through the stages of grief from denial to bargaining, if not yet acceptance, have begun to suggest that Trump might be preferable to Cruz. Trump is, if you squint, a sort of moderate Republican; he\\u2019s a dealmaker; and surely he\\u2019s craven enough to reverse his most alienating positions and say what people want to hear if he gets to the general election. Cruz, on the other hand, is an ideologue. The scariest prospect of all is that he really means what he says, and might, if elected, take it upon himself to actually upend the establishment\\u2019s cherished status quo.\\u201d  GOP POWER INDEX: CHRISTIE FADES   New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has painted himself a straight-talker since he was elected to the governorship in 2009, and has made it a cornerstone of his presidential campaign\\u2019s \\u201cTelling It Like It Is\\u201d slogan.  Town hall videos of his early days as governor hit the Internet, and people around the country were drawn to this frank, no nonsense guy. When he took on the teacher\\u2019s unions, and was asked about his own children\\u2019s private education, he responded, \\u201cIt\\u2019s none of your business,\\u201d which resonated with people tired of hearing exhaustive explanations from politicians.  But his straight-talk attitude hasn\\u2019t quite delivered on is message of late. As Christie tries to find a path from the middle of the pack in New Hampshire to national viability, he\\u2019s come under increasing scrutiny. And voters are hearing a lot more run-on sentences than they were used to from Christie.  In the Fox Business Network Debate last week, Christie claimed that he never supported Justice Sonya Sotomayor\\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court, but his statement at the time reads: \\u201cI support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination. Qualified appointees should be confirmed and deserve bi-partisan support.\\u201d  It\\u2019s been the same of gun control. Although he has vetoed limits on clip-size and photo IDs for gun owners, Christie\\u2019s record on guns is scattered. National Review\\u2019s Jim Geraghty points out that in a 1993 race for New Jersey Senate, Christie issued a statement asserting that\\u00a0\\u201cwe already have too many firearms in our communities. The issue which has energized me to get into this race is the recent attempt by certain Republican legislators to repeal New Jersey\\u2019s ban on assault weapons. In today\\u2019s society, no one needs a semi-automatic assault weapon.\\u201d In November 2015, Christie told Bret Baier in an interview for \\u201cSpecial Report\\u201d that he didn\\u2019t remember making that statement.

Send your thoughts to\\u00a0  DRIVEN BY DESTINY   On a day when we remember the legendary figure of Martin Luther King Jr., NPR shares the reminiscence of Tom Houk, King\\u2019s driver and body man at the peak of the Civil Rights movement. Houck headed to Atlanta to join the movement and was surprised at being picked up by Dr. King and his wife Coretta Scott King, with the reverend at the wheel. After lunch that day, she asked Houck if he might drive the children to school the following day: \\u201c[J]ust like that, Houck began his stint as the Kings' family driver. For nine months, Houck drove Martin Luther King Jr. around Atlanta, though King liked to drive himself often, too. \\u2018But he was a terrible driver,\\u2019 Houck says. \\u2018And he turned WAOK radio in Atlanta on full blast.\\u2019  That wasn't the only puzzle presented to Houck. There were also the cigarettes. \\u2018Dr. King was a chain smoker, all right? But Coretta did not like the cigarettes,\\u2019 Houck says. \\u2018So when we would come back to the house, first thing Coretta would do, she would check Dr. King's pockets. So he started giving me his cigarettes.\\u2019 In the midst of the struggle, Houck found himself a co-conspirator in King\\u2019s vice. And with good reason: Houck idolized the reverend for his virtues.\\u201d  Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day? Sign up here.

As the ATF faces a firestorm of controversy for seeking public comment on a proposal to ban a popular type of bullet, critics last week claimed the agency may have decided in advance how it would rule.  They pointed to the ATF's latest \\\"Firearms Regulation Reference Guide,\\\" released in January 2015. The guide, curiously, did not contain an exemption for popular \\\".223 M855 'green tip' ammunition\\\" that was included in earlier guides. Without that exemption, the ammunition is illegal to sell.\\u00a0(The change in language was first noticed by Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich at Townhall.com.)  So did the ATF already make up its mind?  No, the agency claims. The ATF has responded that the reference guide is not legally binding, so the bullets have not actually been banned yet, and has apologized for leaving the exemptions out of the guide. They say it was an innocent mistake. And the proposed ban is apparently still under consideration.  \\\"[It] was an error which has no legal impact on the validity of the exemptions,\\\" ATF public affairs chief Ginger Colbrun told FoxNews.com in an emailed statement, adding that it will be corrected soon.  \\\"The 2014 Regulation Guide will be corrected in PDF format to include the listing of armor piercing ammunition exemptions and posted shortly... \\u00a0ATF apologizes for any confusion caused by this publishing error.\\\"  As of Monday, the 2014 guide with the error was no longer available on the ATF website.  Case closed? Perhaps. Gun-rights supporters say that such errors are common for the ATF -- but that it could also have been a tip-of-the-hand that the administration already had reached a decision on banning the bullets.  \\\"This is either real incompetence or ATF got caught with their pants down. With this administration it could be both,\\\" Alan Gottlieb of the Second Amendment Foundation told FoxNews.com.  The controversy comes on the heels of a letter from a hundreds of lawmakers urging the ATF not to ban the popular ammunition, which is the focus of regulatory efforts because it can pierce bulletproof vests used by law enforcement.  These lawmakers say the regulation would interfere with Americans' Second Amendment rights.  \\\"This attack on the Second Amendment is wrong and should be overturned,\\\" Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., who started the petition, said in a statement to FoxNews.com. \\\"Now 239 bipartisan Members of Congress -- a clear, sizeable majority of the House -- agree,\\\" he noted.  Although the ATF previously approved the bullets in 1986, the agency now says that because handguns have been designed that can also fire the bullets, police officers are more likely to encounter them.  White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest backed up the agency's proposal at a press conference last Monday.  \\\"We are looking at additional ways to protect our brave men and women in law enforcement... This seems to be an area where everyone should agree that if there are armor-piercing bullets available that can fit into easily concealed weapons, that it puts our law enforcement at considerably more risk,\\\" Earnest said.  But gun-rights groups such as the National Rifle Association note that almost all rifle bullets can pierce armor, and say that this is just an excuse for limiting civilian gun use.  \\\"The claim that this is done out of a concern for law enforcement safety is a lie. The director of the Fraternal Order of Police has said this is not an issue of concern. And according to the FBI, not one single law enforcement officer has been killed with M855 ammunition fired from a handgun,\\\" Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, told FoxNews.com.  Some law enforcement groups reached by FoxNews.com also say that they see no need for the regulation.  \\\"The notion that all of a sudden a new pistol requires banning what had long been perfectly legal ammunition doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to many officers,\\\" William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, told FoxNews.com.  NAPO represents over 1,000 police units and associations and 241,000 law enforcement officers around the country.  But some law enforcement experts support the ban.  \\\"I am definitely for the banning of these rounds... officers worry about them all the time,\\\" former NYPD detective Harry Houck told FoxNews.com, though he added that a ban might not actually keep criminals from getting the ammunition.  \\\"We understand why law enforcement has always been concerned about the threat of armor-piercing bullets,\\\" Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, told FoxNews.com.  Lawmakers warn that the regulation -- especially as it follows on the heels of attempts to restrict lead bullets -- will \\\"result in drastically reduced options for lawful ammunition users.\\\" Already, the ammunition has been cleared from many store shelves by gun owners looking to stock up in anticipation of the ban. The proposed regulation would not prohibit owning the bullets, but it would stop anyone from manufacturing or importing them.  The ATF has announced that it is currently taking public comments on the regulation until March 16, when it will prepare to issue a final regulation. Comments can be sent to .

Muslims kidnapping vulnerable white girls in the UK and forcing them to be sex slaves has reached an epidemic level, according to a recent report from the UK Charity Barnados. They say that Muslims are setting up fake businesses, primarily car washes, when, in reality, they are brothels and transit houses for these kidnapped girls:  Barnardo\\u2019s claims girls are being ferried from one unit to another as sex slaves for Kurds[s].  It suggests white British girls on the run from the care system in Hartlepool, Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough are being targeted.  The report said: \\u201cThere were connections between people that work in car washes and the sexual exploitation of children on Teesside.  \\u2026  Officers on the immigration-led operation found beds at one. It was suggested staff were living on the premises.  Cleveland Police said: \\u201cIt was not confirmed that child sexual exploitation had taken place although enquiries were conducted.\\u201d ( source )  This is a sad and sickening picture of what the UK has become. Once one of the safest places in the West, it has allowed itself to become little more than a third-world cesspool, where its own women are being sold like slaves in the Muslim bazaars of old, and the government refuses to do its job to stop it, instead allowing it to continue and trying to stop those who want to put a stop to it.      *Article by Andrew Bieszad\",\n          \"The atmosphere created by conservatives and their anti-transgender witch hunt is becoming more and more apparent by the day. The trend started by North Carolina, with Texas in the process of following suit, is to restrict bathrooms to  gender at birth.  In other words, a transgender woman with double-dee breasts who is wearing a miniskirt would be required to subject herself to harassment by going into the men s room to do her makeup. To most, this is not in any way reasonable. As someone who identifies as a woman, she belongs where she is most comfortable: the women s restroom. But to the uneducated, unwashed religious bigots in our country, she should have to live her life in a constant state of discomfort.But the hysteria has reached a point that even cisgender (biological women who identify as women) must worry about the backlash when one of God s Chosen Imbeciles decides they don t look feminine enough. One such woman is Aimee Toms, who was recently rudely informed that she doesn t belong in the women s restroom. Why?Toms was minding her own business, simply washing her hands at a Walmart in Danbury, Connecticut on Friday when another woman approached her and informed her  You re disgusting!  and  You don t belong here! At the time, Toms was wearing a baseball cap and had very short hair, so she says she can understand why someone might think she is transgender. While her appearance doesn t matter one iota, the reason her hair was short at the time will make the bigot she encountered feel very, very stupid. In a video she posted online, she informed her new hater: Do you know why my hair is so short? In January, I made my third donation to Pantene s Beautiful Lengths Program. Do you know what they do? They take hair donations and they make them into wigs and they give them to cancer patients free of cost. Now, I am damn happy to rock a pixie cut if some kid gets my hair and gets to wear it. And that s worth it to me.You know what isn t worth it? Being discriminated against in a bathroom by some fucking asshole who thinks they have a right to decide what gender I am and that they have a right to judge me for it. After experiencing the discrimination they face firsthand, I cannot fathom the discrimination transgender people must face in a lifetime,  she says.  Can you imagine going out every day and having people tell you you should not be who you are or that people will not accept you as who you are? At this point, the hate is getting ridiculous. Most people have used a restroom with someone who is transgender at some point in their lives without noticing. If daytime talk shows are any indicator, there is a hefty supply of men who have had sexual relations with a woman who happens to have a penis   and they didn t give a flying f*ck at the time. People are people. Transgender people are people who happen to have been born into the  wrong body,  so to speak. There is no harm in a society allowing people to simply be who they are without fear of reprisals. Unfortunately, the American Right disagrees because reasons.Watch Toms lay the smackdown on the haters below: image via Newstimes\",\n          \"Try as they may, Republicans have just not figured out how to connect with younger generations. They ve locked down a good portion of older white America, but it seems millennials just really don t want much of anything to do with them.However, in an attempt to try to appeal to this younger vote in an election year, the House Republicans decided they would join Snapchat, the infamous social app that deletes what is sent shortly after sending it. It s hugely popular among younger Americans, so they thought they d give a whirl.One problem, though. The man who they used in the GIF to advertise their Snapchat campaign was NOT happy they used him.How do you do fellow kids? House GOP will Snapchat the #SOTU  #SNAPoftheUnion   mcbc (@mcbc) January 12, 2016You see, the man in the House GOP s #SnapOfTheUnion campaign is none other than HitFix writer Louis Virtel who also happens to be openly gay. The GIF highlights a moment he snapped his fingers while appearing on Jeopardy last May.Here s Virtel s reaction to being used by the GOP: Hey, GOP! Your candidates are horrifying garbage who ve done nothing for LGBT rights. Don t use my image. GOP, I think every day about closeted gay kids who want to kill themselves because their parents are ignorant, fearful Republicans. Dear GOP: The reason people liked my snap was because it defied regressive, homophobic, scary-ass losers like you. My image is STILL on the odious GOP site.

Louis Virtel (@louisvirtel) January 13, 2016Well done! Way to tell them, Louis!Too bad that GIF is still up on their website, and they are clearly either too stupid or too pompous to take it down. Likely both.The GOP will never catch the clue that younger generations just DO NOT like them for their blatantly derogatory actions taken against not only the gay community, but against nearly every minority in existence. They need to realize, hopefully sooner rather than later, that they are myopic in their views and archaic in their policy. They also need to learn how to make sure the people they are using in their campaigns are on board with being used. However, it s clear they just don t care.Featured image: GOP.gov\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"links\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

And I think that is an astonishing statement. \\u201d \\u201c[I]t\\u2019s very clear that Comey hates Trump,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cI think Congress should now intervene and should abolish the independent counsel because Comey makes so clear that it\\u2019s the poison fruit of a deliberate manipulation by the FBI director leaking to the New York Times to deliberately set up this particular situation.

I mean, if you remember this March 23rd date, where this kind of blew up, that was not any deadline. That was a   deadline. And what happened was, the bill really wasn\\u2019t ready for primetime. You hadn\\u2019t developed a consensus. You set a date to vote on it without having the consensus. And so, what\\u2019s happened since then, is members are talking to each other, and really the administration, I think has done a good job. Vice President Pence has been exercising a lot of leadership to try to figure out how do we actually fulfill the promises we made to the American people, and for me the core thing that we have to do is deliver lower premiums and more choice on private insurance, because that is the reason why people dislike Obamacare because their premiums have gone up and their deductibles have gone up. So, that\\u2019s really what we have to do, and I think if we can get there, I absolutely think we can pass something, relatively soon. \\u201d DeSantis added that he thinks the House is getting closer to an Obamacare bill. Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter \",\n          \"ST. LOUIS   Former St. Louis police Officer Jason Stockley was found not guilty Friday of murdering a man while on duty.St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson s highly anticipated verdict found the white former St. Louis police officer not guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action in the December 2011 shooting death of a black drug suspect after a high-speed pursuit and crash.Activists, with support from some of the city s black clergy, had pledged disruptive protests ahead of Wilson s verdict.Wilson addressed such statements in his order:  A judge shall not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism. Immediately after the verdict was issued, protesters gathered downtown near Tucker Boulevard and Market Street. They blocked a ramp to Interstate 64 off Clark Street, but were blocked by police from entering the highway. Protesters then headed to police headquarters.St. Louis Police reminded protesters that blocking traffic is illegal and is not protected by the First Amendment: Per Ord. 17.16.275, it is unlawful for a person to obstruct & impede the reasonable movement of vehicular or pedestrian traffic. #STLVerdict  St. Louis, MO Police () September 15, 2017As the protests grew, Wells Fargo and Nestle Purina PetCare sent their nearly 7,000 employees home for the day.Police officers were seen preparing for potential riots:Bike cops are seen amassing in #DowntownSTL. #JasonStockley has been found NOT GUILTY      KMOV () September 15, 2017Damone Smith, 52, an electrician headed to work, was among the motorists being rerouted from the protest area. I think the verdict is disgusting,  said Smith, who is black.  I m proud of these people protesting. If you look like me, then you feel like there is no other way to express yourself in the face of this kind of verdict. Time and time again, African American men are killed by police and nobody is held accountable. The judge explained his rationale for the verdict in a 30-page document filed about 8:30 a.m. Friday. No one promised a rose garden, and this surely is not one,  he wrote of the case. This court, as the trier of fact, is simply not firmly convinced of defendant s guilt. Agonizingly, this court has pored over the evidence again and again   This court, in conscience, cannot say that the state has proven every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt or that the defendant did not act in self-defense. Because the state did not prove Stockley did not act in self-defense, Wilson wrote that he could not address lesser charges of homicide or manslaughter. St. Louis Police Department called for peace:We know emotions are running high, however we ask that those who choose to protest, do so peacefully. #STLVerdict  St. Louis, MO Police () September 15, 2017The fiance of the victim Anthony Lamar Smith, Christina Wilson, bravely stood in front of a microphone just prior to the court s announcement and asked for protesters to not resort to violence. Inspired by your courage, Christina. Honored to stand with you and call for peace in #STL.    Eric Greitens () September 15, 2017Meanwhile, on social media, people who have become famous for doing absolutely nothing but race-baiting, like Tariq Nasheed, are stirring the pot, and totally disrespecting the wishes of Smith s fiance. The unconstitutional #JasonStockley verdict is further proof that LE & the court systems have been fully infiltrated by white supremacists  Tariq Nasheed () September 15, 2017The Mayor of St. Louis used her opportunity to call for peaceful protests in her city to instead, stir the pot by suggesting that justice was not served, potentially leading angry protesters to believe it is now their responsibility to deliver justice:Mayor Lyda Krewson released a statement following the verdict saying,  I am appalled at what happened to Anthony Lamar Smith. I am sobered by this outcome. Frustration, anger, hurt, pain, hope and love all intermingled. I encourage St. Louisans to show each other compassion, to recognize that we all have different experiences and backgrounds and that we all come to this with real feelings and experiences,  she wrote.Krewson s comment drew a rebuke from Neil Bruntrager, Stockley s lawyer. How do you promote all those things by creating distrust in a system that clearly worked under these circumstances?  Bruntrager said.  It is irresponsible and a disservice to the community to make statements like that. It s an insult to Judge Wilson to make statements like that. And it falsely encourages the belief that an injustice was done here when in fact justice was done.

LOUIS   Former St. Louis police Officer Jason Stockley was found not guilty Friday of murdering a man while on duty.St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson s highly anticipated verdict found the white former St. Louis police officer not guilty of first-degree murder and armed criminal action in the December 2011 shooting death of a black drug suspect after a high-speed pursuit and crash.Activists, with support from some of the city s black clergy, had pledged disruptive protests ahead of Wilson s verdict.Wilson addressed such statements in his order:  A judge shall not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism. Immediately after the verdict was issued, protesters gathered downtown near Tucker Boulevard and Market Street. They blocked a ramp to Interstate 64 off Clark Street, but were blocked by police from entering the highway. Protesters then headed to police headquarters.St. Louis Police reminded protesters that blocking traffic is illegal and is not protected by the First Amendment: Per Ord. 17.16.275, it is unlawful for a person to obstruct & impede the reasonable movement of vehicular or pedestrian traffic.   St. Louis, MO Police () September 15, 2017As the protests grew, Wells Fargo and Nestle Purina PetCare sent their nearly 7,000 employees home for the day.Police officers were seen preparing for potential riots:Bike cops are seen amassing in .  has been found NOT GUILTY      KMOV () September 15, 2017Damone Smith, 52, an electrician headed to work, was among the motorists being rerouted from the protest area. I think the verdict is disgusting,  said Smith, who is black.  I m proud of these people protesting. If you look like me, then you feel like there is no other way to express yourself in the face of this kind of verdict. Time and time again, African American men are killed by police and nobody is held accountable. The judge explained his rationale for the verdict in a 30-page document filed about 8:30 a.m. Friday. No one promised a rose garden, and this surely is not one,  he wrote of the case. This court, as the trier of fact, is simply not firmly convinced of defendant s guilt. Agonizingly, this court has pored over the evidence again and again   This court, in conscience, cannot say that the state has proven every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt or that the defendant did not act in self-defense. Because the state did not prove Stockley did not act in self-defense, Wilson wrote that he could not address lesser charges of homicide or manslaughter. St. Louis Police Department called for peace:We know emotions are running high, however we ask that those who choose to protest, do so peacefully.   St. Louis, MO Police () September 15, 2017The fiance of the victim Anthony Lamar Smith, Christina Wilson, bravely stood in front of a microphone just prior to the court s announcement and asked for protesters to not resort to violence. Inspired by your courage, Christina. Honored to stand with you and call for peace in .    Eric Greitens () September 15, 2017Meanwhile, on social media, people who have become famous for doing absolutely nothing but race-baiting, like Tariq Nasheed, are stirring the pot, and totally disrespecting the wishes of Smith s fiance. The unconstitutional  verdict is further proof that LE & the court systems have been fully infiltrated by white supremacists  Tariq Nasheed () September 15, 2017The Mayor of St. Louis used her opportunity to call for peaceful protests in her city to instead, stir the pot by suggesting that justice was not served, potentially leading angry protesters to believe it is now their responsibility to deliver justice:Mayor Lyda Krewson released a statement following the verdict saying,  I am appalled at what happened to Anthony Lamar Smith. I am sobered by this outcome. Frustration, anger, hurt, pain, hope and love all intermingled. I encourage St. Louisans to show each other compassion, to recognize that we all have different experiences and backgrounds and that we all come to this with real feelings and experiences,  she wrote.Krewson s comment drew a rebuke from Neil Bruntrager, Stockley s lawyer. How do you promote all those things by creating distrust in a system that clearly worked under these circumstances?  Bruntrager said.  It is irresponsible and a disservice to the community to make statements like that. It s an insult to Judge Wilson to make statements like that. And it falsely encourages the belief that an injustice was done here when in fact justice was done.   St. Louis Dispatch\",\n          \"Tonight s the night of the Golden Globe Awards, and comedian Jimmy Fallon was tapped to emcee the event. Before he even started his opening monologue, his teleprompter failed, so he ad libbed the whole thing. And he used the opportunity to take an awesome dig at Donald Trump for it.We all know by now that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 3 million, but Trump still won thanks to the way the Electoral College works. Fallon touched on that when he said: This is the Golden Globes, one of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote. Our manchild of a  leader  doesn t like things like this very much. Trump has been railing off and on about the popular vote controversy, despite the fact that his electoral votes secured his win, despite the fact that the electors still voted for him on Dec. 19, and despite the fact that Congress just certified that vote over the protests of several House Democrats and many Americans. He has been quiet of late about it, but he still seems to be smarting over his popular vote loss.Fallon didn t stop there, though. He also compared Trump to  Game of Thrones  King Joffrey, saying: [Game of Thrones] has so many plot twists and shocking moments, a lot of people are wondering what it would be like if King Joffery had lived. Well, in 12 days we re gonna find out,were carefully tabulated by the accounting firm Ernst and Young and Putin. Watch Fallon s digs below:: Watch Jimmy Fallon ad-lib his opening monologue after the teleprompter malfunctions    Hollywood Reporter () January 9, 2017Everyone can argue until the cows come home about whether Fallon was actually funny tonight, but nobody can argue that he took a serious dig at the ridiculously egotistical and thin-skinned Trump in front of millions of Americans. It ll be interesting to see if he replies.Featured image by Paul Drinkwater/NBCUniversal via Getty Images\",\n          \"After much back and forth between the white dude wearing a  Black Lives Matter  t-shirt and the black man who appears to be acting as security for corrupt Hillary, the black man suggests he go to the back of the line and ask secret service for permission to enter. The good news is that it appears the line to see Hillary (as usual) is pretty short. If he had to get to the back of the line for a Trump event, that could have been an issue.

            "The mastermind of the “Bridgegate” lane closure scandal that helped torpedo New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s presidential bid should not be sentenced to prison due to his cooperation, U.S. prosecutors said in a court document filed on Tuesday. David Wildstein, who helped the government convict two former Christie associates after he pleaded guilty in 2015, is set to be sentenced in federal court in Newark on Wednesday. Wildstein, 55, admitted overseeing a scheme to shut down access lanes at the busy George Washington Bridge in 2013 to create massive traffic gridlock as punishment for a local Democratic mayor who refused to endorse Christie’s reelection campaign. U.S. prosecutors charged Wildstein, former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly and a former executive of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Bill Baroni, with concocting the plot. The Port Authority supervises operations for the George Washington Bridge, which connects Manhattan and New Jersey and is one of the world’s busiest crossings.     Christie, who has denied any involvement, was not charged. But the fallout dogged his bid for the Republican nomination for president in 2016 and has contributed to his current record-low approval rating of 15 percent in New Jersey. Wildstein pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 2015 and agreed to cooperate with authorities, eventually appearing as the star witness at Kelly and Baroni’s trial for eight days of testimony. “Put simply, were it not for Wildstein’s decision to cooperate and disclose the true nature of the lane reductions, there likely would have been no prosecutions related to the bridge scheme,” U.S. prosecutors wrote in arguing that Wildstein should receive probation but no prison time. Kelly and Baroni were sentenced to 1-1/2 and two years in prison, respectively. Wildstein testified at trial that he and Baroni joked with Christie about the traffic jams caused by the lane closures as they were occurring, an assertion that Christie and Baroni both denied. He also told jurors that he and Baroni used the Port Authority as a “goody bag” to dole out favors to local officials in exchange for support for Christie’s re-election. In a court submission made public on Tuesday, Wildstein’s lawyer also requested probation, noting that Wildstein voluntarily met with investigators at the start of their probe. “Mr. Wildstein remains alone in taking responsibility for his role in the George Washington Bridge lane realignment issue, even though others were clearly involved,” Alan Zegas wrote. \n",
